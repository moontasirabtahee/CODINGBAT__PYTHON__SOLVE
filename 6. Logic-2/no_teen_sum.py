# Given 3 int values, a b c, return their sum. However, if any of the values is a teen -- in the range 13..19 inclusive -- then that value counts as 0, except 15 and 16 do not count as a teens. Write a separate helper "def fix_teen(n):"that takes in an int value and returns that value fixed for the teen rule. In this way, you avoid repeating the teen code 3 times (i.e. "decomposition"). Define the helper below and at the same indent level as the main no_teen_sum().
# no_teen_sum(1, 2, 3) → 6
# no_teen_sum(2, 13, 1) → 3
# no_teen_sum(2, 1, 14) → 3

def no_teen_sum(a, b, c):
    newList = [a,b,c]
    sum = 0
    for i in newList:
        if i not in [13,14,17,19,18]:
            sum += i
    return sum
